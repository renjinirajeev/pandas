# Used for Data manipulation
# Which includes data analysis and data cleaning
# Data analysis: to extract desired information from the data
# Data cleaning: missing value handling, to remove unwanted data


# Pandas_eda Data Structure

# Any data should be converted to a particular order before it gets analyzed.
# A data structure is the form in which the data is arranged
# In python, there are 4 data structures: List, tuple, set, dictionary

# There are 3 types of data structures in pandas:
#           1. Series
#           2. Data Frame
#           3. Label

# The conversion of the data into a particular data structure depends on the form in which the data already is.
# If the data to be analyzed is one-dimensional, the data is converted into series data structure.
# Eg: List, Set, Tuple, Dictionary
# If the data to be analyzed is two-dimensional, the data is converted into dataframe data structure.
# Eg: Nested list, text file, csv file
# If the data to be analyzed is three-dimensional, the data is converted into label data structure.
